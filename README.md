Dynamsoft Barcode Reader
=========
version 6.5

Introduction
-----------

Dynamsoftâ€™s [Barcode Reader SDK][1] enables you to efficiently embed barcode reading functionality in your application using just a few lines of code. This can save you from months of added development time and extra costs. With the Barcode Reader SDK, you can decode barcodes from various image file formats (bmp, jpg, png and tiff). This includes from device-independent bitmap (DIB) formats which can be obtained from cameras, scanners, etc.

Two editions, for Windows and Mac, are available. The Windows Edition provides C, C++, ActiveX / COM and .NET APIs. The Mac Edition provides C and C++ APIs. You can use the SDK in various development environments, such as Visual Studio .NET (C# / VB.NET), Visual C++, VB6, Delphi, Eclipse, Xcode, etc.
